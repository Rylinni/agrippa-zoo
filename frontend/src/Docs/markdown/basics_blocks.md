# Blocks

Blocks are an organizational feature of the markup language. When using the model visualization tool, blocks are looked to first as the displayed graphical node. Children of a block can be viewed only once that block has been selected. 

**Every `node` must be inside a block.**

The `block` tag takes a `title` attribute, which is used for expositional purposes. They also take optional tags like `rep` and `stretch`, which are discussed in the Advanced Features section of the docs.
