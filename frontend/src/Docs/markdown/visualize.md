# Visualize

Once you have created a project, you can upload the zipped folder on the Agrippa website. 

## Metadata

Blocks and nodes containing `<desc>` tags will have those tags displayed in the details sidebar. For example, inside a block, you can provide a description of the block's functionality like:

```
<desc>
    Your description here!
</desc>
```
