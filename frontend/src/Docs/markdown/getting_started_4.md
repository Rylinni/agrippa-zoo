# Uploading and Visualizing

## Uploading

Once you have completed a building a model, please upload and share it with others so that they can benefit from your example. There is no need to upload this getting started project to share, but do share new ones that you've created. To do so, first you should register for an account on this website and proceed to login. Once logged in, you can navigate to the upload page.

Give your model a **name** (like "ResNet-18" or "Audio Captioning Transformer"), give **author names** (like "Ellsworth Fersch" or "Vaswani et al"), and a **short description** (like "Convolutional image classifier" or "Pre-trained model to caption audio from classrooms using a Transformer").

**Input and output tags** are meant to convey what kinds of inputs/outputs your model expects. For example, for a transformer model, there might be two input tags "text" and "tokens". Perhaps also you might add "matrix" or "2d matrix", if that is how the data is meant to be given to the model. For the outputs, you might tag "probabilities", "distribution", and/or "2d matrix".

A **"canonical"** model is meant to be the kind of project that contains a highly portable, agnostic, and flexible architecture that can be used on many tasks. For example, a "Transformer Decoder" project could be canonical, but a "Transformer Decoder with LeakyRelu Activations trained on ImageNet" should not be marked as canonical. You may use your judgement to decide whether users searching for the canonical version of a model would want to find your project. The Agrippa staff may alter the labeling of your project.

Lastly, you should **upload a zip file** of your project folder and list the index file. The index file is the file that you pass to the "index" variable when you export the project. It is the first file that is displayed in the visualization tool.

Click submit, and, hopefully, your model is publicly available.

## Visualizing

Once you have uploaded your model, you can go to its page from the Model Zoo and click through to view the model in the **Workspace**. From there, you can browse the model's files, click on nodes to see their children and attributes, or double click on blocks to view inside them.
