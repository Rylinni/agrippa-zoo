# Identity

`op="Identity"`

The identity operation. It does nothing. It must have only one input or parameter. It is sometimes useful for when you want to share a parameter across different parts of the model, but you need to alter the parameter first before using it somewhere (such as when you need to take its transpose). It can also be useful for renaming inputs for use in different parts of a model.
